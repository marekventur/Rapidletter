This is an old university project of mine. It's pretty outdated and barely workd. I'm only keeping it here for reference sake.

It was basically a lightweight web version of MS Words letter templates. You pick a style and fill in address and text and out comes a well formated letter. The idea was to combine it with a print-and-post on demand service, but no one used it and therefore I removed that option. 

Oh, and it's also in German. Sorry for that.

Do whatever you want with this code, but use at your own risk.
